In this step a check is performed to detect the COM1 serial line.
If it is present a relative message is displayed.

In this step I added a simple script tool/changes.sh that prints all the
files changed from a previous step.

For example suppose you have two directory with two differents level of code:

step(X) and step(X+1)

cd in step(X+1) and type:

tools/changes.sh <path>step(X)

the list of files changed will appear.

Files changed
-------------
serial.c (new)
serial.h (new)
tty_io.c
