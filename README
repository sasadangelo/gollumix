Add the 5th console that will be used for serial communication.

To prompt a login, run on a linux box

		setsid agetty 38400 ttyS0 ansi.

On the 5th console of our kernel will appear the login prompt.
Type user name and password and login on the system.

if during ls command you see CTRL characters, please unalias the ls command
in this way:
	
		unalias ls

and if these characters appear on the prompt, redefine the PS1 env variable
in this way:

		export PS1=\>
