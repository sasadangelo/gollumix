Here we want to add a better support for IRQ.
Add a new file traps.c to define the interrupt traps for all IRQs and change
asm.S to implement a more flexible infrastructure.

With this new infrastructure it will be possible associate an handler to an IRQ
simply using the routine add_irq_handler.

Files modified:
---------------
asm.S
irq.c
irq.h (new)
keyboard.c
linkage.h (new)
main.c
Makefile
