Add the support for exception handling. Basically if an exception occurs,
the CS and EIP register must be printed and the number of Exception.
The build process should produce a System map that will be used to map
CS:EIP with a kernel routine. 
This will be very useful for debug purpose, to understand where the exception
occured in the code.
